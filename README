Installation

 Theme

If you are installing the theme for the first time, use the template installation in the WBCE backend and follow the instructions.

> If you want to update the backend theme, then you have to uninstall the old installation first!

Custom logo / favicon

For a custom logo you have to create an image with the name backend-theme-logo.png. The logo has to be a PNG-based image, should have a max width of 224px and a max height of 96px.

Same as the logo, you can also create a custom favicon with the name backend-theme-favicon.png. The logo has to be a PNG-based image and should have a max width of 256px and max height of 256px.

Both images have to be uploaded into the root-directory (next to the config.php) or into the media-folder of the WBCE installation.

> The custom favicon should be a square image.
