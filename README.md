# About

Fraggy Backend Theme is a responsive and Bootstrap based template for the backend of [WBCE](http://wbce.org).

> There might be some design issues at the backend of older modules, but usually the modules still work as expected.

# Download

You can download the newest source code release and the distributed release without source files [here](https://github.com/rjgamer/Fraggy-Backend-Theme/releases).

# Installation

## Theme

If you are installing the theme for the first time, use the template installation in the WBCE backend and follow the instructions.

> If you want to update the backend theme, then you have to uninstall the old installation first!

## Theme logo

If you want to replace the default theme logo, then you have to create a logo image called theme-logo.png and replace the existing one in the image folder of your backend theme installation.

> The logo must be a PNG-based image and should have a max width of 250px and a max height of 86px.
