## About

Fraggy is a responsive and Bootstrap based backend theme for [WBCE](http://wbce.org).

**Attention:** There might be some design issues at the backend of older modules, but usually the modules still work as expected.

## Download

You can download the newest source code release [here](https://github.com/rjgamer/Fraggy-Backend-Theme/releases) and the distributed release without source files [here](https://fraggy.neoflow.ch/downloads/).

## Installation

If you are installing the theme for the first time, use the template installation in the WBCE backend and follow the instructions.

**Attention:** If you want to update the backend theme, then you have to uninstall the old installation first!
