# Installation

## Theme

If you are installing the theme for the first time, use the template installation in the WBCE backend and follow the instructions.

> If you want to update the backend theme, then you have to uninstall the old installation first!

## Theme logo

If you want to use a custom backend theme logo, then you have to create a logo image with the name backend-theme-logo.png and upload it into the root-directory (next to the config.php) or into the media-folder of your WBCE installation.

> The logo must be a PNG-based image and should have a max width of 224px and a max height of 96px.

> Don't forget to clean your session storage or reopen your browser if you've replaced the backend theme logo.
