# About

Fraggy Backend Theme is a responsive and Bootstrap based template for the backend of [WBCE](http://wbce.org).

> There might be some design issues at the backend of modules, but usually the modules still work as expected.

# Requirements

The backend theme requires [WBCE v1.3.1](https://github.com/WBCE/WBCE_CMS/releases) or newer.

# Changelog

## v2.0.2 - released on 2018-02-05

 * Fixed and optimized auto updater

## Older versions

You can see the summary of releases and the changes in each release [here](https://github.com/rjgamer/Fraggy-Backend-Theme/releases).

# Download

You can download the newest source code release and the distributed release without source files [here](https://github.com/rjgamer/Fraggy-Backend-Theme/releases).

# Installation

## Theme

If you are installing the theme for the first time, use the template installation in the WBCE backend and follow the instructions.

> If you want to update the backend theme, then you have to uninstall the old installation first!

## Custom logo / favicon

For a custom logo you have to create an image with the name backend-theme-logo.png. The logo has to be a PNG-based image, should have a max width of 224px and a max height of 96px.

Same as the logo, you can also create a custom favicon with the name backend-theme-favicon.png. The logo has to be a PNG-based image and should have a max width of 256px and max height of 256px.

Both images have to be uploaded into the root-directory (next to the config.php) or into the media-folder of the WBCE installation.

> The custom favicon should be a square image.
