## About

Fraggy is a responsive and Bootstrap based backend theme for [WBCE](http://wbce.org).

**Attention:** There might be some design issues at the backend of older modules, but usually the modules still work as expected.

## Download

## Installation

### Theme

If you are installing the theme for the first time, use the template installation in the WBCE backend and follow the instructions.

**Attention:** If you want to update the backend theme, then you have to uninstall the old installation first!

### Additional logo
